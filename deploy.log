As of Cloud SDK 492.0.0 release, new functions will be deployed as 2nd gen functions by default. This is equivalent to currently deploying new with the --gen2 flag. Existing 1st gen functions will not be impacted and will continue to deploy as 1st gen functions.
You can disable this behavior by explicitly specifying the --no-gen2 flag or by setting the functions/gen2 config property to 'off'.
